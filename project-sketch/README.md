## Planned Tools ##

I plan to use following packages in R :

	`ggplot2`
	`shiny`
	`reshape` - Data munging

I am also exploring following packages as of now to see if it makes sense to use them as well:
	`rcharts`
	`ggmaps`



## Planned Techniques and Interface ##

1) Barplot - Barplot though simple but will give a very clear picture of the money being trnaferred.I plan to have a drop down based on origin country and barplot will plot sorted bars of target countries where money was trnasferred. Users can play around an explore data and find out which countries display interesting trends.

2) Heat Map - Using heatmap I plan to give a snense of how much money is transferred to particular countries. I am planning to divide countries into region and then let users give the flexibility to switch to region wise view instead of countries view if they so desire.

3) Multi Line plot -  I have data for last 3 years and the user will be able to discover how the money transfer trends look within last three years. We'll be able to discover if for some countries the remmitances are increasing over a period of time or if they are decreasing.

4) World HeatMap : I amplanning to plot a heatmap on the worldmap and by varying the color intensity based on eithe outflow of money or inflow. User can interact by choosing a color scheme based on either inflow or out flow.

Here is how the interface will look like:
